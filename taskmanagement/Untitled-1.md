I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing to provide an update on the assessment and offer my apologies for missing the extended deadline.

I encountered unexpected challenges that caused the delay. However, I have now successfully completed the assessment and am ready to submit it for your review. I understand the importance of timeliness and take full responsibility for the initial delay.

I appreciate your understanding and the opportunity to continue with the assessment process. Please let me know the preferred method for me to share my submission, and I will promptly follow your instructions.

Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience my delay may have caused, and I thank you for your patience and consideration.

Best regards,
