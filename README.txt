Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of the Task Management Web Application, which allows users to manage tasks. The application is built with a frontend using React.js and a backend using Python Flask.

Features
Frontend (React.js)
Task List

Clicking the edit button populates the form with the task's current title and description.
After editing and submitting the form, the task is updated in the list.

Delete Task

Provides a button to delete tasks.
Clicking the delete button removes the task from the list.

Axios/Fetch API
